# linearClock01

idk this is my first personal project. I'm still trying to figure shit out

## Purpose
A couple lines of pixels at the bottom of the screen showing the time linearly, similar to a progress bar of the day.
Linear clocks supposedly help against time blindness for example for people with ADHD/ADD.
Very rudimentary functioning application with no user input yet.

## How to set it up
I would recommend turning it into an exe file using `pyinstaller`. 
You can execute it manually or save it to `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` for it to run as soon as you log in. 
To close it, open the Task Manager and end the task called 'linearClock01'.

## Future potential features
Add option to customize 
- position (bottom, side, top, inside edge of taskbar or outside edge of taskbar)
- colour (hex)
- toggle segmentation
- width of the bar (individual)
- 12h/24h
